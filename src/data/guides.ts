          'Almost always, yes. Flipping b and d — or p and q — is one of the most common things a five- or six-year-old does as they learn to write, and on its own it is not a sign of dyslexia or a learning disability.',
          'Here’s the thing that makes letters uniquely hard: in the rest of a child’s world, a cup is a cup whether it points left or right. Letters are the first objects a child meets where direction changes the meaning. A brain that has spent years learning to ignore an object’s orientation now has to start paying attention to it. That takes time to click.',

Telling them apart depends on visual discrimination (noticing which way the circle faces) and remembering a consistent motor pattern for forming each one. Both skills are still developing at this age.',
          'Reversals usually fade on their own as reading and writing practice pile up and the correct forms become automatic. Practice that helps tends to do two things: work on one confusable pair at a time, and pair a memorable cue with the correct movement (for example, making a “bed” with two fists so the b and d point inward like the headboard and footboard).',

Our free Letter Reversals worksheet does exactly this: print it at Ages 5–6, “Just right”, and it keeps a single target letter in view so your child rehearses the correct one many times on one page.',
          '2. Turn it into a hunt. A letter-hunt (cancellation) page — circle every b hidden among d, p and q — builds the quick left-to-right scanning that reading needs, and it feels like a game. Print our Letter Hunt worksheet and set the target to “b”.',
          '3. Use a consistent cue. The two-fists “bed” trick, or “b has its bat before its ball,” works because it ties the shape to a little story. Pick one cue and use only that one — switching cues is what confuses kids.',
          '4. Make it multisensory. Have your child trace the letter big in the air, in sand, or on a foggy window while saying its sound. Movement plus sound sticks better than looking alone.',
          '5. Keep sessions short and frequent. Five focused minutes most days beats a long weekend session. Stop while it’s still fun so your child stays willing to come back to it.',
